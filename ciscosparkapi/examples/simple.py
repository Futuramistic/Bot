"""Simple ciscosparkapi demonstration script.

Very simple script to create a demo room, post a message, and post a file.
If one or more rooms with the name of the demo room already exist, it will
delete the previously existing rooms.

The package natively retrieves your Spark access token from the
SPARK_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable.  You must have this environment
variable set to run this script.
